# Guard tests for coop-setup-org.sh's routing vocabulary/charset checks.
#
# These guards exist to fail loudly when the routing config drifts from Osprey's
# vocabularies. A guard that cannot go red is not a guard, so every case below that
# expects rejection IS a positive control: it proves the check discriminates rather
# than merely passing. Run: bash divine/test-coop-setup-guards.sh
#
# TWO extractions, deliberately:
#   REAL_BLOCK  starts at CATROUTES, so it carries the SHIPPED routing array and the
#               guard validates the config we actually provision. An earlier version of
#               this file started below CATROUTES and re-declared the array by hand --
#               which meant poisoning the real CSAM route left these tests green. The
#               config is the artifact worth testing; a hand-copy of it is not.
#   GUARD_ONLY  starts at CANONICAL_REASONS, for driving synthetic rows.
